The text used for this animation is stored in text.txt its from a show called Naruto. Example content includes:

"When you give up, your dreams and everything else, they’re gone.

A person becomes strong when they have someone they want to protect. 

The pain of being alone is not an easy one to bear.

I’m not going to run away, I never go back on my word. That’s my nindo: my ninja way!

Power is not will. It is the phenomenon of physically making things happen."

This text is dynamically split into individual letters for animation.


Overview
The animation transitions between two states:

Floating Letters (Initial State):

Letters from the chosen text float randomly across the screen with slow, smooth motion.
Each letter has its own position, speed, size, and opacity.
Clock Formation (Triggered on Click):

On mouse click, the letters smoothly animate into a circular clock-like layout.
The text dynamically rotates around the clock face.
Clock hands (hour, minute, and second) appear at the center, representing real-world time.
Multiple Click Toggle:

Clicking the canvas toggles between the floating state and the clock state.
